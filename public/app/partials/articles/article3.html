            <p>I grew up in urbanizing Mumbai of the 70’s in Bandra (resembled Goa of to-day), which is totally urbanized, corrupt, and yet cosmopolitan and fast paced, as any modern city of other countries in the world can be. I am still, a living mystic in my family, as the last link left between the generation which was pre-partition India, my middle-class (they think) parents, and the post Y2k-India born kids, my own children, who only e-think in the virtual world. The past, is as unreal to them, as their virtual world is to me or their grandparents. Though I manage to struggle and embrace all new technology trends, products, services, passwords and accounts, I too gasp for the older simpler way of life like my parents who have blinked and missed many a trend, some consciously, some winked at and passed on, deliberately.</p>
            <p>During my formative years, growing up in Mumbai,entertainment meant watching movies over weekends, in suburban theatres in Bandra, called Gaiety Galaxy Gemini, for less than Rupee twenty per ticket. These could be purchased by my father who could drop us to our convent school in Catholic dominated Bandra, and swish his car around swiftly across SV Road to purchase tickets himself. He also returned from work on Saturdays early, post-lunch by 3pm, after finishing his grocery and fruit shopping from Sakhari Bhandar and Bandra-station’s pavement based fruit marts. I heard many a story, of their simple led lives in pre-partion India, when an ice-cream dolly would be affordable at less than one or two annas. Four annas comprised twenty-five paise which even in my teen-age years had a better bang for its worth, than a five rupee coin ( two hundred times twenty-five paise) today. While choco-bars did last through my mother’s childhood, till I was in my teens, we would also gorge on brown choco-vanilla pre-fitted scoops of ice-cream that fitted inside a cone available at our theatres, with lip-smacking Guru Krippa samosas from Sion. Sadly you can no longer buy tickets by easily driving around, without having a concrete plan. You must do your bit to fight a jam, to reach the theatre after e-booking your tickets. Stress is so much in the air, that movies denote the pace, style, and speed of how fast you can go to a donor centre to even create children. Sign of times, change is no longer in the air, because air cannot seep through the cracks of your latest multiple door refrigerator at home. Change has come upon us, in full T-20 cricket speed, in 150CC motorbike speed, and in T-2 International airport speed (finally!).</p>
            <b>Today’s children</b>
            <p>The children today base their comfort ahead of the entertainment or choice of movies, by goading about their ability to see movies at PVR, where they can laze and doze, in super chilled air-conditioned comfort of their pop-corn tummies tucked inside their pull-overs. This is due to their over-inflated pocket-monies, or the inflated egos of us upper class (we think) parents, who make them richer than our first starting salaries as their base line pocket money today. Phone bills come extra as a perk for being our kids. Ice-creams are avoidable due to pollution filled air in Mumbai, and the smog caused by diesel filled SUV’s we all drive around. Everyone knows how many calories a samosa carries. So the best thing to do is roll-over after a movie plan with five times the monthly budget of yesteryear blown on a meal at a suburban hotel or eatery. You may find quality food, that is disappearing fast from Mumbai city, but not faster than the shocking speed with which your kids guzzle drinks, or hanker over who will choke first on their 899th pasta meal. Nevertheless, the price of phones that parents fetch for their children is more than the monthly salaries of not just their grand-parents, but their own selves few years back. What class we belong to, is reflected in all our choices beyond even movies, schools, tuition, restaurants we visit and holidays and meals we take and make. Our access to excess, has taken us further away from contentment and satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Is this progress? Car’s like Fiats and Ambassadors, and heroes like Dilip Sahib and Shammi Kapoor, or even Dev Sahab, that we watched repeatedly on Doordarshan are unknown to our children. Perhaps they are only a faded memory of our parents having watched them at Plaza, Maratha Mandir, Chitra or Naaz cinema. It’s tough to even make them digest recent heroes of our generation, least of all those from the generations of our parents, many of whom have passed away. Slowly, the older virtues and symbols of our entertainment, concepts, culture, heritage, and history are being swept away. It’s no longer the in-thing to sit at Juhu Beach or Chowpatty with a bed sheet, and carry your own sandwiches. It’s cooler to eat at a Café, which India has now an overwhelming choice of. A tea-drinking nation, is tripping over the American trend of coffee and burgers. Two hundred Udipi restaurants shut down in Mumbai in the past few years, and Irani restaurants do not find support from their nex-gen to help the ageing owners, as their kids and grand kids have left the country. Indian NRI’s overseas, send liquid money and own hot assets, including real-estate, FCNR’s and Equity while their visas continue to be renewed in developed economies on the cusp of quarterly and half yearly recessions, or tapering what have you. By the time many citizens trip over, or city residents visit an old spot of our city that should have been preserved for cultural or arts reasons, they will find a changed landscaped, and a population of people, that no longer carry the same smell, taste, look or feel. While I reflect and think of my ever-green past, my wife brings me to the present, by ordering her groceries from the neighbourhood friendly baniya and chides me for not checking the last month’s total credit bill racked up with them. My son orders my printer cartridge from e-bay, with a discount coupon from his telecom company, and reminds me to fetch the rest of the groceries, from the air-conditioned mart on my way back from work.</p>
            <i>"Penny for your thoughts? Mine are filled with nostalgia and memories, worth perhaps a chavanni to the next generation. Sad, but true, my parents would have paid at least their prized two annas for it."</i>
